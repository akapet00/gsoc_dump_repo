    "I will work on the project *Support of the simulation-based inference with the model fitting toolbox* together with my mentor Marcel Stimberg and the rest of the model fitting team under the [Brian simulator](https://briansimulator.org/) project.\n",
    "Brian is a free and open source, cross-platform simulator for biological neurons and spiking neural networks.\n",
    "It is written in the extremely efficient manner using the Python programming language and the entire code-base is open sourced and available [on GitHub](https://github.com/brian-team/brian2).\n",
    "\n",
    "`brian2modelfitting` toolbox allows the user to find the best fit unknown parameters for recorded traces and spike trains.\n",
    "The focus of my project is the integration of the `sbi` library into the `brian2modelfitting` toolbox to extend currently implemented fitting capabilities for custom excitable single cell models with simulation-based inference techniques.\n",
    "This will enable `brian2modelfitting` to not only result in a single set of optimal parameters, rather in the full posterior distribution over parameters.\n",
    "It will also expolit prior system knowledge sparsely, using only the most important features to identify mechanistic models which are consistent with the measured data by means of recorded traces and spike trains.\n",

    "So my advice to any potential 2022 GSoC student is: do not hesitate to sign up, do not hesitate to get in touch with anyone who can help you to become a GSoC student, be a good person, and do what you love and do your best. Note that the GSoC can be very hard, sometimes extremely stressful, but it all pays off once you submit the last pull request :)\n",
