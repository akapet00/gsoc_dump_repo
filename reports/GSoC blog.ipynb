    "\n",
    "I will work on the project *Support of the simulation-based inference with the model fitting toolbox* together with my mentor Marcel Stimberg and the rest of the model fitting team under the [Brian simulator](https://briansimulator.org/) project.\n",
    "Brian is a free and open source, cross-platform simulator for biological neurons and spiking neural networks.\n",
    "It is written in the extremely efficient manner using the Python programming language and the entire code-base is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/brian-team/brian2).\n",
    "\n",
    "`brian2modelfitting` allows a user to find the best fit unknown parameters for recorded traces and spike trains.\n",
    "The focus of my project is the integration of the `sbi` library into the `brian2modelfitting` toolbox to extend currently implemented fitting capabilities for custom excitable single cell models with simulation-based inference techniques.\n",
    "This will enable `brian2modelfitting` to not only result in a single set of optimal parameters, rather in the full posterior distribution over parameters.\n",
    "It will also expolit prior system knowledge sparsely, using only the most important features to identify mechanistic models which are consistent with the measured data by means of recorded traces and spike trains.\n",
    "`sbi` library is a completely separate effort and its development is coordinated at the [mackelab](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/research/research/cluster-research-groups/professorships/machine-learning-in-science/).\n",

    "During the first period of the project, i.e., from May 17th to June 7th, all students have to participate in something called *Community bonding*, during which we are required to become familiar with the community practices and processes by actively participating on mailing lists, IRC, Gitter etc.\n",
    "Me personaly, I waited for a couple of days to have my first virtual meeting with Marcel.\n",
    "He explained the inner workings of GSoC and the INCF (International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility), an international non-profit umbrella organization that embrace principles of Open, FAIR and Citable neuroscience, under which Marcel also operates for the duration of the GSoC.\n",
    "We agreed to have casual video calls each week, communicate daily via e-mail, Gitter, and Github issues, but make our best to keep the most of the communication open for the entire community through the official Brian discourse channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "I delved deep into both `brian2modelfitting` and `sbi` documentation.\n",
    "I also went through a couple of relevant tutorials:\n",
    "* [official `brian2` online tutorials](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/resources/tutorials/index.html);\n",
    "* [examples](https://github.com/brian-team/brian2modelfitting/tree/master/examples) on `brian2modelfitting` GitHub page;\n",
    "* [all tutorials and examples](https://www.mackelab.org/sbi/) that are offered from `sbi` development team.\n",
    "\n",
    "I read a couple of recent papers that cover the simulation based inference:\n",
    "* a review paper by Cranmer et al. [[2020](#Cranmer2020)], where the authors outline principles of modern simulation-based inference supported by likelihood-free statistical approach and machine learning;\n",
    "* a JOSS paper by Tejero-Cantero et al. [[2020](#Tejero-Cantero2020)]., that covers implementation details of `sbi` library and goes into details of currently implemented families of neural inference algorithms;\n",
    "* preprint by Lueckmann et al. [[2021](#Lueckmann2021)], in which the authors investigate performance of many simulation based inference algorithms;\n",
    "* and eLife article by Gonçalves et al. [[2020](#Gonçalves2020)]., where authors show concrete examples in which the simulation based inference truly shines.\n",

    "* Pro Git book, relevant chapters, freely available [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).\n",
    "\n",
    "After the second virtual meeting, Marcel and I agreed that the next steps should be:\n",
    "1. installing all dependencies for the future work and creating a development environment;\n",
    "2. opening issues on GitHub that would closely resamble tasks for the first coding phase, i.e., from June 7th up to Phase 1 evaluations scheduled on July 12th.\n",

    "#### What have I get done this week?\n",
    "* Played with more advanced examples in `sbi` and went through the [Introduction to Brian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAF3UWTzX9A) online workshop.\n",
    "* Started to work on the wrapper class for first stages of simulation-based inference that will ultimately allow the user to obtain posterior over the unknown parameters with a few simple lines of code, issue [#44](https://github.com/brian-team/brian2modelfitting/issues/44).\n",
    "* Investigated dimensionality reduction techniques that automatically extract the relevant features from the traces and, therefore, allow the user to avoid the process of manually extracting summary statistics used to feed a neural density estimator of choice. I brushed up my knowledge on dimensionality reduction by going through the last year's Neuromatch Academy tutorial on the topic and then researched stete-of-the-art methods, specifically Time2Vec neural network embedding that provides a model-agnostic vector representation for time by Kazemi et al. [[2019](#Kazemi2019)]. This is related to issue [#45](https://github.com/brian-team/brian2modelfitting/issues/45).\n",
    "* Found out the way to efficiently store the results from the first stages of simulation based inference that are known to be time consuming, issue [#46](https://github.com/brian-team/brian2modelfitting/issues/46).\n",

    "* Had a virtual meeting with Marcel where we discussed the implementation details of the feature metric by using `eFEL` library, currently in use in `brian2modelfitting` toolbox.\n",
    "* While learning on feature extraction from electrophysiological data traces, I read the paper by Bandt and Pope [[2002](#Bandt2002)], in which the authors propose permutation entropy as the simple, light-weight and robust measure of complexity for time series data, as such perfect for the voltage traces we deal with.\n",

I found out interesting package called `antropy` that provides multiple time-efficient algorithms for computing the complexity of time-series. Decided to try it out on the example of simulated voltage traces from the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model and proposed a pull request where the correlation between entropy metrices for voltage traces is showcased. [My example](https://github.com/raphaelvallat/antropy/blob/master/notebooks/complexity_corr_membrane_potential.ipynb) has been merged to the master branch of `antropy` repository, and is now available as the official example :)\n",
